# Company Card
Everyone at Expected Behavior receives their own company card to simplify mundane day-to-day business. 

You may not find any use for your card for a while, but please don't lose it. There will always come a time when you'll need some payment-gated tool or piece of knowledge to make good progress on your work. It's best if you don't need to interrupt anyone else to make that happen.

# Expense Reports
We use Expensify to track and categorize our expenses on a monthly basis. You do not need to record or upload any receipts for your expense report.

# Per Diem
There is no fixed budget when traveling for Expected Behavior. Our average Monday Night Dinner behavior is a good guide for what we consider appropriate spending. If weâ€™ve asked you to travel for work, please enjoy yourself. Go have a couple of drinks, a nice dinner, or see a movie. If there are nearby Expected Behavior customers and you feel like inviting them to join you, we'll pay for that too.

# Budgets
Expected Behavior has an annual budget process that takes into account the most kinds and quantities of things people want to buy. Common things people buy include
- paying for [Monday Night Dinner](benefits.md)
- buying office snacks
- signing up for a new SaaS product to implement a feature
- buying work-related educational material (tell us about it and share what you learn, please)

We've already budgeted for the common things, so you don't need to ask about them. Just use your company card and be on your way.

If you want to buy something unusual in kind or size, talk to Matt or James about it. If it's small, we'll probably just re-allocate some other budget and you can have it right now (e.g. "I've been working from home a lot and my equipment is bad. Can I get $1000 for a new desk and chair?").

If you want something large (e.g. "I think we should renovate the entire office"), you'll want to participate in the annual budget process. You can do that indirectly by asking a partner to include it in their budget. You can also participate directly  in the Basecamp conversation when it comes around. Participation doesn't guarantee approval - there are always far more good ideas for expanding and improving Expected Behavior than there are resources - but we'll do our best to make it happen or explain why it can't happen yet.
