# Work Hours
There are no official office hours. According to our [flexibility principle](flexibility.md), each person sets their own schedule including work days and hours. You're responsible for making sure that the work gets done, but we think it's best if you're free to optimize your schedule.

# Working From The Office
There is usually somebody in the office between 9am and 7pm on most workdays. Some of us work an hour or two from home and then come in, or vice-versa. The morning is usually lower attendance than the afternoon. Monday is the most attended office day, because of [Monday Night Dinner](benefits.md). Friday is the least attended office day, because Friday. 

It doesn't matter if you'll be the first in or the last out. You won't need anyone to open the office for you or close it up when you're done. You'll have complete access. 

# Working From Home
We want you to be excited about coming to work at the office with the rest of us while simultaneously feeling completely free to work from home or the coffee shop. Maybe you want some alone time or need to focus. Or maybe you have sick kids, dentist appointments, or car problems. [Notify people](communication.md) about your expected availability as necessary.

Most people work from home at least one day a week. Again, that day is almost never Monday and very frequently Friday.

If you are sick, please work from home or take the day off. We want for you to get better and we do not want to get sick.

# Working Remotely
Many of Expected Behavior policies are very remote friendly, but a lot of our key cultural elements revolve around seeing each other in person at regular intervals. We've tried fully remote work in the past and it had a significant impact on the company. If you want to work a week (or five) from somewhere, we think that's great. Just be mindful of the frequency and duration of your trips. If you're interested in being a full blown digital nomad while working at Expected Behavior, let's talk! We're not fully prepared for that right now, but we're interested and open to improving. You can help us figure out how to be more [flexible](flexibility.md).
