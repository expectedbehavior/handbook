# Everything Is Possible
When people say something is impossible, they very rarely mean it. What they actually mean is
- they don't know how to do it
- they don't want to do it
- they think it will cost too money
- they think it will take more time than is available

It's much more productive to actually say "It will cost 500 million dollars to add laser haircuts as a company benefit" or "I don't know how to design a laser haircut system that isn't lethal", because those can lead to productive conversation. Why $500 million? Is there a part of the requirements driving up the cost? What if we're flexible on the survival rate?

No one knows everything. Just because you don't know how to [rotate an infinitely long cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipler_cylinder) doesn't mean your coworkers don't. Avoiding "impossible" allows for the kind of collaboration that makes an [intentionally small](intentionally_small.md) company like Expected Behavior possible.

Please don't say anything is impossible unless you're prepared to reduce the problem to a heuristic-resistant form of the halting problem or show it violates one of the known physical constants of the universe.
