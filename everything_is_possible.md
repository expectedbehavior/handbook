# Everything Is Possible
When people say something is impossible, they very rarely mean it. What they almost always mean is one or more of:
- they don't know how to do it
- they don't want to do it
- they think it will cost too much
- they think it will take more time than is available
- they don't want to talk about it

It's much more productive to say "It will cost 100 trillion dollars to add laser haircuts as a company benefit. That's a problem because it's greater than the GDP of every country on Earth." Or maybe say "I don't know how to design a laser haircut system that isn't lethal. I think you'll want a 100% survival rate." Those kinds of responses can lead to productive conversation. Why 100 trillion? Is there a part of the requirements driving up the cost? What if we're flexible on the survival rate?

No one knows everything. Just because you don't know how to [rotate an infinitely long cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipler_cylinder) doesn't mean your coworkers don't. Avoiding "impossible" allows for the kind of collaboration that makes an [intentionally small](intentionally_small.md) company like Expected Behavior do incredible things.

Please don't say "impossible" unless you're prepared to provide a detailed, cogent argument demonstrating that conclusion. That will probably involves showing it violates one of the widely-believed-unbreakable physical constants of the universe. Instead, focus on communicating the specific blockers between you and the stated goal.
