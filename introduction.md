# What is this?
The point of this handbook is to make it easier to get started at Expected Behavior by describing some parts of our culture and how we do things. Culture, like software, is either dead or constantly changing. If you spot something you think is worth improving (e.g. inaccurate, unclear, etc), please say something or make a pull request. 

# How should I use this handbook?
I'm not sure yet! This is the first version, so maybe just read it from start to finish?

# What if I don't have time to read the whole thing?

The most important thing to know about Expected Behavior is that we strongly prefer guidelines over [bright lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-line_rule). You should assume that everything at the company is a guideline, even if it's written in an authoritative, this-is-the-way kind of tone. There will always be exceptional situations that require throwing the guidelines or best practices overboard. Your judgement as a smart and dedicated professional is the critical difference that makes Expected Behavior work and will always be required. That includes this handbook. And the thing I just wrote. It's judgement all the way down, is what I'm saying.

# What if I do have time to read the whole thing?
Hooray! Here are the things you'll want to know
