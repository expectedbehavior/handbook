# What is this?
The point of this handbook is to make it easier to get started at Expected Behavior by describing some parts of our culture and how we do things. Culture, like software, is either dead or constantly changing. If you spot something you think is worth improving (e.g. inaccurate, unclear, etc), please say something or make a pull request. 

# How should I use this handbook?
I'm not sure yet! This is the first version, so maybe just read it from start to finish?
