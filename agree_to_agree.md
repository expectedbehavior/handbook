# It's worth taking the time to agree.
You will disagree with other people at Expected Behavior, sometimes strongly. When that happens, the best thing you can do in most cases is to talk about it until you agree. Agree to agree, if you will.

# It seems like that's going to take a lot longer than agreeing to disagree.
That may be true in this once instance, but life is long. It's extremely likely this kind of disagreement will come up again and again. Each instance will be cheaper to solve by avoiding the problem, but eventually the cost of many disagreements will exceed the cost of coming to an understanding.

Additionally, there's a morale cost to doing a thing you don't believe is right or best. One of the best things about running an [intentionally small company](intentionally_small.md) is the ability to care deeply and specifically about happiness. It's worth taking the time to protect that.

# So I can _never_ agree to disagree?
[Never say never](everything_is_possible.md). If the product is down right now, it may not be the best time to have a four hour conversation about the meaning of "root cause". [Use your judgement](guidelines_over_brightlines.md).
