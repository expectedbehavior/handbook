The most important thing to know about Expected Behavior is that we strongly prefer guidelines over [bright lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-line_rule). You should assume that everything at the company is a guideline, even if it's written in an authoritative, this-is-the-way kind of tone. There will always be exceptional situations that require throwing the guidelines or best practices overboard. Your judgement as a smart and dedicated professional is the critical difference that makes Expected Behavior work and will always be required. That includes this handbook. And the thing I just wrote. It's judgement all the way down, is what I'm saying.
