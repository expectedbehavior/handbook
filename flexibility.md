# Flexible systems work best.
This idea permeates the company, but the most obvious example is how we work. Everyone is different, so everyone's ideal working conditions are different. That's why we work hard to design every aspect of the business to maximize your choice while still achieving our business goals. It's why you get to choose which days you work and which hours on those days. It's why we have very few meetings and even fewer recurring ones. 

Please consider how your decisions will impact the flexibility of others. Our rules don't specifically prohibit working exclusively from 10pm to 6am, but how will that impact your ability to pair with your project partner? Sometimes [asking for a face to face meeting](communication.md) is the best move, but it's also dictating the place and time a person will be working. Were they already going to be at that place? Working at that time? Are you increasing their travel time? Breaking up their work day?
