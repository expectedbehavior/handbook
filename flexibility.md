# Maximize useful flexibility.
Let's talk about the push and pull between these two ideas.

- No two people or things are exactly alike. Embracing differences maximizes outcomes.
- A difference that makes no difference is no difference.

Our goal is to provide every useful choice to the people that work at Expected Behavior, while avoiding the waste of solving problems we'll never have.

It's why you get to choose which days you work and which hours on those days. It's why we have very few meetings and even fewer recurring ones. We've made a lot of choices to maximize your flexibility so you can be at your best, but we have to work together to keep it that way for everyone.

Please consider how your decisions will impact the flexibility of others. Our rules allow you to work exclusively from 10pm to 6am, but how will that impact your ability to pair with your project partner? Sometimes [asking for a face to face meeting](communication.md) is the best move, but it's also dictating the place and time a person will be working. Were they already going to be at that place? Working at that time? Are you increasing their travel time? Breaking up their work day? Is there a more flexible way of accomplishing the same goal?

Likewise, please [politely challenge others](communication.md) if their choices are limiting flexibility that's valuable to you. Flexibility isn't free, so we can't always deliver. But, we find that the extra value from working in optimal conditions nearly always makes up for the cost. As always, [use your judgement](guidelines_over_brightlines.md).
