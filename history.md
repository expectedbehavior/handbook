Expected Behavior was found in 2007 by Jason and Matt. It started as a product company working on Recommendy. After a year of diligently adding features to Recommendy - far too many features - they realized they lacked a lot of knowledge and skills to effectively bring a product to market. 

In 2008, they switched to consulting. It went much better. Expected Behavior eventually worked with many of the largest technology brands in the world, along with lots of very cool smaller companies.
