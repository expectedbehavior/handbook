# How should I communicate?
Let's talk about tone first. 

All of your communication should be courteous, empathetic, and honest. We're entirely opposed to the "it's ok to be mean if you're right" philosophy that many companies harbor. 

It's possible to disagree strongly or deliver bad news to someone while still being nice. You'll know you're on the wrong side of the line if someone is upset at your communication and you say (or think) something like "it's the truth" or "you know I'm right". Courtesy and correctness are orthogonal. 

Likewise, "I didn't say anything because I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings" will not be viewed favorably. We're counting on you to share your perspective. If you'd like help communicating your thoughts, please ask a senior Behaviornaught. They'll be happy to help you.

Now let's talk about the mechanics!

Most of your communication should be in writing. We believe communicating in writing has many long term benefits for the company, including
- Time for you to consider your words
- Time for you to find and cite helpful sources
- Time for others to consider their response
- Easy historical reference

Most of your communication should be internally public. That doesn't necessarily mean that everyone should get a push notification for all your communication, but almost anyone in the company should be able to look up almost any thing anyone has talked about. That makes it easy for others to cite and build on your past work.

# Where should I communicate?
Our communication is designed around giving everyone at Expected Behavior maximum flexibility. 

Always choose the most asynchronous, most permanent medium that will get the job done on time. Avoid becoming overly dependent on communication styles that emphasize your co-workers being in a particular place or working at a particular time. 

Here's a breakdown roughly using the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method)

**Important and Urgent communication that requires action in less than ~24 hours** should be done face to face. Failing that, a zoom call. Failing that, a phone call. Failing that, a text message. You are responsible for making sure that everyone that needs to receive this communication acknowledges receipt. This should be very, very, very rare. Consider this if 
- one of our products is down when it should not be down and you need help to fix it
- you're in charge of coordinating a goof off event and have to change the plan with less than one business day of notice
- a meteor will strike the Earth shortly
- you are currently on fire

**All other Important Communication** should go in Basecamp. This should be the overwhelming majority of your communication by word volume. Basecamp is the only place everyone in the company is required to check and stay up to date on. If you put something in Basecamp and notify the people that need to know, it is now their responsibility to read it. On average, please check Basecamp at least once per day and try to optimize for responding to messages that are waiting on you. It's ok to check Basecamp only once a day. It's ok to go more than a day without checking Basecamp as long as you're mindful of blocking others. This is a good choice for
- project updates
- keeping track of the things you need to do
- describing a non-trivial idea to the company
- having a conversation that can't be easily completed in a few minutes
- anything someone else at the company _must_ know
- a meteor that will strike the Earth some time next week

**Unimportant Communication** can go in Slack. Semi-real time communication like Slack can be helpful when many people are working at the same time. It's expected that you'll be in Slack most of the time when you're working, but it's ok if you're not. I sometimes turn it off to reduce distraction when I need to focus. It's ok to ignore Slack indefinitely. It's ok to go on vacation and never read any of the messages you missed.  

Everything in Slack should be transient ("I'm doing some testing on server1 for the next hour") or optional ("Here's a picture of a duckling watching a baby rabbit eat a carrot"). Rarely, you may feel the need to straddle the line between Important and real time. You can solve that by posting to Basecamp and putting a link to your post in Slack. Please try to avoid [wuphfing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrVskziCc4w) people. Slack is a good choice for
- letting people know you're deploying or otherwise doing stuff that could be relevant to other people working at that same time as you (transient)
- sharing links to funny or interesting things on the internet (any channel)
- sharing links to sad or angry thing on the internet (probably the politics channel, more below)
- letting people know about your schedule for the day (e.g. if you normally come into the office on Monday, but your car broke down so you'll be working from the shop until it is fixed)
- coming up with new post apocalyptic communication jokes with other Behaviornaughts

# My attempts at written communication are failing.
Two things here.

First, never write a message when you're having negative feelings about the thing you're talking about. If you're failing because you or someone else is having negative feelings about the topic/words/whatever, please abandon writing and talk as synchronously as possible. Written communication is great, but it's leaves a lot of nuance on the table. Sometimes we need facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and real time feedback to get on the same page. We've been doing a written-first culture for a long time. Pushing through negative feelings to write a message almost always makes the situation worse instead of better. If you're at that point, either go to the person or write a message saying "I'd like to talk about this in person". You don't have to say more than that. Everyone, including you, will know what it means and respect it.

Second, get a buddy! Asking for review of the written word is extremely common at Expected Behavior. You can get help by
- asking the person next to you
- saving your Basecamp post as a draft and sending the link to someone with a request for review (simple things or quick reviews)
- putting it in a Google Doc and sending it to someone for review (complex things where you may want many detailed suggestions or comments)

# When should I make new channels in Slack?
Never. I mean it. For the love of science, please don't make any more channels. According to Slack analytics, we average 3 messages per channel per day across the ones we already have and use (excluding channels we have with zero messages in the past 30 days). Our busiest channel boasts a whopping 12 messages per day. We have almost twice as many channels as we have people. It's just not necessary. Do not want. 

# What do the channels in Slack mean?
Most of the channels are easy to figure out, so I'll just cover a few.

Secret Chat is the catch all channel. If you're not sure where to put something, you can put it in here. As long as it's not political. Please put that in the politics channel.

The War Room is used only *during an ongoing incident*. Typing in that room means you think there's a Serious Problemâ„¢ right now. If you have things to add to an incident that is no longer in progress, copy a link from the War Room thread and continue the conversation in the relevant product channel.

The politics channel is probably the most important to understand. It is the place to talk about things that are controversial and unrelated to work. All conversations about or relating to politics or [the culture war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war) must go in the politics channel. A good rule of thumb is your source. If it is from a news organization or about a topic that major news organizations are covering or regularly cover, it probably belongs in politics. Some things can straddle the line. For example an article titled "World Famous Restaurant Switches To All-Meat Menu To Stick It To The Liberals" is about food and also about politics. That means it belongs in politics, not in the food channel.

Some people prefer to not discuss controversial topics at work. 

If you would prefer not to discuss politics, please ignore the politics channel. It's an entirely optional experience for people who want to participate. Do not feel obligated or pressured. The politics channel exists because politics is a part of life and some people want to express that part of life with their coworkers. 

If you choose to participate, you may be exposed to ideas or positions you strongly disagree with. It is ok to disagree and provide constructive counterarguments. It is ok to criticize _ideas_ (e.g. "that will have disastrous results"). It is not a good idea to criticize people (e.g. "anyone that believes that is an idiot"). It's easy to become hyperbolic about controversial topics. I caution you to consider that you may not always know what your coworkers believe and nobody has ever been insulted into changing their beliefs. If you attack and trivialize your coworkers' deeply held beliefs today, you still have to work with them tomorrow.

# Do you use Campfire in Basecamp?
No, we've tried that and it's bad. It forces a mix of important/unimportant and synchronous/asynchronous communication through the same notification channel that makes it hard to be a good participant in the company without wasting time.
